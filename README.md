# JOHTnotes
JOHTnotes is a web platform where students can import and watch lecture videos, while being able to make notes with embedded clickable timestamps within the videos. JOHTnotes also generates a transcript for each imported video, allowing users to easily search for keywords and jump to timestamps where they are referenced.

This project was created as a submission to Hack the North 2021: https://devpost.com/software/video-annotator
